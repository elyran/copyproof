# CopyProof
### Copy the impossible

A command line tool for copying corrupted files, even when some bytes are unreadable.
It just skips the unreadable bytes.

Good for when a partial copy is fine, like with media files.

Give it a try if xcopy or robocopy have failed you.

### Usage

This script runs on NodeJS. Once it's installed, do the following (command line):

* Install dependencies with: `npm install`
* Execute the script for more details: `node index.js`
